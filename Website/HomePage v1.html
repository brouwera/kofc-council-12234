		<h4>Knights of Columbus - Home Page</h4>
		<br>
		How Did We Start?
		<br></br>
		<p>The Knights of Columbus was founded on February 6th, 1882 by Father Michael J. McGivney in St Mary’s Parish in New Haven, Connecticut.  In October of 1881, he organized a meeting with other men of the Parish to discuss a growing issue at the time.  What do we need to do to help families in need if the “breadwinner” was to pass away or unable to provide for their family?  He suggested to create an organization of Catholic men to help provide for these families in need.  By February of 1882, the first officers were elected to lead the new founded organization.  They used Christopher Columbus and their symbol by recognizing him as a Catholic and to celebrate him being the discoverer of America.  Catholic men driven by the Knights’ firm beliefs of servings one’s community, family, and faith with virtue.</p>

		<br>
		What About Today?
		<br></br>
		<p>Today, the Knights of Columbus still stand to the same beliefs that were bestowed on us in that time.  As of 2016, we were close to having 2 million members, and are still growing today.  We still provide for the needy in our community, but also extend that to our current members today.  As of 2016, we succeeded in beating our 2015 figure of $175 million, and raising our charitable services earned to over $177 by volunteering over 75 million hours of service.</p>
